This example shows how to couple an external code with TMCMC. In this example the external code is a simple python code
but you can substitute it with anything.

1. go to ./source and run make
2. copy 'sample' to the 'example' folder
3. go to the 'example' folder and run './sample'

For each model evaluation needed from TMCMC a folder is created (tmp_dir.0.*.0.0). The contents od the folder 'model'
are copied into tmp_dir.0.*.0.0 and the doall.sh script is being called. In this script the model function 'my_model.py'
as well as the likelihood function are being called. You can substitute the 'my_model.py' and the data.dat in the 'model' 
folder with your favorite model and data file.

At the end of the model evaluation the tmp_dir.0.*.0.0 is not being deleted. If you want to remove it you have to recompile the
code with 
	#define REMOVEDIRS  1
in the source/fitfun.c
