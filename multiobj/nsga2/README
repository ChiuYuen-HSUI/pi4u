We provide a task-parallel version of the NSGA-II multiobjective algorithm.
We have introduced minimal modifications to the original sequential code
developed at Kanpur Genetic Algorithms Laboratory (KanGAL, IIT Kanpur) by
the authors of the algorithm [(C) Dr. Kalyanmoy Deb 2005, see the Notice file].

You can find more information about the NSGA-II code in the Readme file, 
which has been slightly modified to include any changes introduced in the
original code.

If you have any questions about the parallel version of this code, 
please feel free to contact Dr. Panos Hadjidoukas (phadjido at mavt.ethz.ch)
